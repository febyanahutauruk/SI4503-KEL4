I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?

Feby
I heard that you're settled down

Indah
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you

Izzah
I heard that your dreams came true

Daffa
That you found a girl and you're married now
